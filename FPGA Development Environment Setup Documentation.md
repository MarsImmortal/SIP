Software Components for FPGA Development Environment Setup:

Quartus Prime: This is the primary software tool for FPGA design and development, provided by Intel (formerly Altera) for the DE10-Nano board.
Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL: If you plan to use OpenCL for FPGA development, this SDK is essential.
Board Support Package (BSP): A DE10-Nano-specific BSP is often required to enable communication between Quartus Prime and the board's hardware.
Linux OS: If you're using a Linux-based development environment, ensure that the OS is compatible with Quartus Prime and the DE10-Nano board.
Version Control System (e.g., Git): To track changes in your FPGA project and documentation.

Hardware Components for DE10-Nano Setup:

DE10-Nano FPGA Board: The physical hardware board you'll be working with.
USB Blaster: A programming cable used to configure the FPGA.
Power Supply: Ensure that you have the correct power supply for your DE10-Nano board.
MicroSD Card: Often used to store the FPGA configuration.
